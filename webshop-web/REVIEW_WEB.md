# Web Review comments from Peter

- CONSIDER to place the RouteSystem.tsx in root (rename to Routes.tsx)
- CONSIDER to place all admin routes below /admin

   /admin
   /admin/edit
   /admin/edit/:id

// SHOULD avoid custom colors & dynamic style names (border-[#00ff00])

// CONSIDER to use default export for a component

// SHOULD create a util to format date & currency (don't repeat in tsx)

// CONSIDER to map product detail on click row (avoid one action on ...)
